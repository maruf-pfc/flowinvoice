<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

Types:
  feat      → new feature
  fix       → bug fix
  docs      → documentation changes
  style     → formatting, no logic change
  refactor  → code change that is not a fix or feature
  test      → adding or updating tests
  chore     → build process, tooling, or dependency changes
  ci        → CI/CD changes
```

**Examples:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat(users): add user authentication module"
git commit -m "fix(health): correct status code in health controller"
git commit -m "test(users): add integration tests for user routes"
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Branch** — Create a branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Code** — Make your changes. New features should live in `src/modules/<feature>/`.

3. **Test** — Ensure all tests pass and add new ones:
   ```bash
   bun test
   bun run typecheck
   ```

4. **Commit** — Use conventional commits.

5. **Push & PR** — Open a pull request against `main` and fill in the PR template.

> PRs that fail CI (lint, typecheck, or tests) will not be merged.
